DONE FOR MILESTONE 3 (NOV. 8)
- Hearts, stars and enemies disappear when prince goes off screen and then comes back
- Another key is spawned after prince takes it and portal appears, leave the screen and then comes back (two key issue)
- If prince goes off screen and comes back repeatedly, key doesn't show up
- If prince goes off screen and comes back to screen with key in it, the key respawns in a different position
- Key generates on first screen of level, making gameplay too easy
- Key will show up next to wall, which makes portal spawn on a wall and make it impossible to advance to next level ):

- prince/wall collision bounceback
- have a fixed number of enemies and stars spawned for each level (don't have all stars spawn an enemy because the game is really hard right now) 
- track how many of the total amount of stars have been collected (i.e. 1/3 stars collected etc.)
- make sure the position of the stars and enemies are far enough from the star position of the prince
- reset key bug: more and more enmeny and stars
